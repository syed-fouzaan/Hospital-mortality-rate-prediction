# Hospital-mortality-rate-prediction
This script creates a PatientICUData table with sample data. It then uses two focused CTE-based queries. The first query filters for patients in 'Medical ICU' with a BMI over 30, ordering by hospital death probability. The second query filters for female patients in 'Surgical ICU', also ordering by death probability.
